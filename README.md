## üì¶ Installation

### Prerequisites
* Python 3.9 or higher
* CUDA-compatible GPU (recommended)
* 8GB RAM minimum

### Setup Steps

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DentalAI-Diagnostics.git
cd DentalAI-Diagnostics
```

2. Create and activate virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
# or
.\venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Download pre-trained models:
```bash
python scripts/download_models.py
```

5. Launch the application:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## üß† Model Architecture

### Network Design
The system employs a fine-tuned InceptionV3 architecture with custom modifications:

* **Input Layer**: 224x224x3 (RGB images)
* **Backbone**: InceptionV3 pre-trained on ImageNet
* **Custom Head**:
  * Global Average Pooling
  * Dropout (0.5)
  * Dense Layer (1024, ReLU)
  * Output Layer (5 classes, Softmax)

```python
def build_model():
    inception = InceptionV3(
        input_shape=IMAGE_SIZE + [3],
        weights='imagenet',
        include_top=False
    )
    
    # Freeze base layers
    for layer in inception.layers:
        layer.trainable = False
    
    # Add custom classification head
    x = GlobalAveragePooling2D()(inception.output)
    x = Dropout(0.5)(x)
    x = Dense(1024, activation='relu')(x)
    predictions = Dense(NUM_CLASSES, activation='softmax')(x)
    
    return Model(inputs=inception.input, outputs=predictions)
```
